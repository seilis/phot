# phot: Simple photography management

phot is a simple photo management tool. Currently under construction...

## Why _another_ tool?

There are many photo management tools that range from simple GUI grid views
to giant content management systems and everything in between. When I was looking
for a tool to manage my growing library of photos, I noticed a few annoyances:

* Not CLI driven; most of my life is in a terminal so a nice CLI interface
  would be nice.

* No simple way of combining libraries from multiple individuals and simple
  interfaces to filter out _my_ photos vs photos belonging to my family members.

* No backups or easy ways of checksumming files in the library. How do I know
  if my library is corrupt?

* Collections are static and/or not easy to add a photo to multiple collections.
  If I want to make a filtered collection (say for making a photobook) of my last
  `$VACATION` it's not easy to add these files to the filtered collection while
  leaving them in the original collection.

* I have more time on my hands due to COVID.
